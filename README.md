# Digital Logic Circuit Collection

This repository contains a collection of digital logic circuits designed using [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) (or tool you use).  
The goal is to bridge software development with hardware understanding.

## 🧠 Why?
As a software developer, I want to understand **how computers operate under the hood**—how memory toggles, registers update, and how logic gates power everything. This repo is my learning log.

## 📂 Circuit Categories
- Flip-flop designs (D, JK, T)
- Counters (4-bit, 8-bit, up/down)
- Registers & Latches
- Multiplexers, Decoders (coming soon)
- ALU and Basic CPU ideas (coming soon)

## How to open
1. Download [Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution)
2. Open any `.circ` file under `/circuits`
